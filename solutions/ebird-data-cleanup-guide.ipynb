    "### Some guidance on HW5\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some advice on how to approach the eBird data for HW5. Let us first explore the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "The datafile is a CSV- so, each column should be split by a comma. However, some lines look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "579,spuh,waterf1,Anatidae sp.,waterfowl sp.,waterfowl sp.,Anseriformes,\"Anatidae (Ducks, Geese, and Waterfowl)\",,\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we split on commas and select for the eight column, we will get this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Anatidae (Ducks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's no good! We either want the full content of that column (i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Anatidae (Ducks, Geese, and Waterfowl)\"\n",
    "``` \n",
    "or just \n",
    "```\n",
    "Anatidae\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "### How can we fix this?!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assuming that you have corrected for the problem with the new-line in the eBird data file**, the following Unix command will modify the file so that fields like \n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Anatidae (Ducks, Geese, and Waterfowl)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "are collapsed to the simpler\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Anatidae (Ducks Geese and Waterfowl)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the unix command, which makes use of the program [`sed`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) to clean up the file (NOTE: replace file names where appropriate):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sed 's/,\\s/ /g' <input_ebird> > <output_file>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We are telling sed to replace the pattern **\"comma, then a space\"** (`,\\s`) **with just a space** (` `).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pause here and take a look at your new output file in your terminal!\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you convinced that your output file is different? If so, you might be ready to move onto the python script."
